## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Jae Ahn-Benton, a full-stack software engineer. 

Coding and programming has always been a part of my life, but never has been in the forefront until recently. However, I think it is time for it to be the center of my professional life, as I bring all of my past skills and passions together to build a new lifelong career in a field that I am interested in and passionate about - a field that I would definitely like to work in until retirement.

### Where did I come from? And why am I here?

I am from Seoul, South Korea, and I immigrated to Las Vegas, NV at age of 10. Until high school graduation, my life revolved around two main things: math and music. Coding was a significant part of my mathematical experience, from making simple games on a TI-84 graphing calculator to writing simple Java programs. I majored in music in college, and got my real estate license in 2019. As I built my experience in both fields, the skills that I honed the most were collaboration with other professionals of the field, catering to the needs of each individual client, and the ability to efficiently solve problems that are often sudden and unforeseen. Combine these skills and my love for programming, as well as my passion to tackle world problems with code, I believe I can be a great asset to any project or company that I become a part of.
