## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Jae Ahn-Benton, a full-stack software engineer. 

Coding and programming has always been a part of my life, but never has been in the forefront until a few years ago. It is now the center of my professional life, where I have utilized all of my past skills and passions together to build a new lifelong career in a field that I am interested in and passionate about - using code to automate the tedious, maximize efficiency, and solve real-life problems. This is a field that I would definitely like to work in until retirement.

### Where did I come from? And why am I here?

I am from Seoul, South Korea, and I immigrated to Las Vegas, NV at age of 10. Until high school graduation, my life revolved around two main things: math and music. Coding was a significant part of my mathematical experience, from making simple games on a TI-84 graphing calculator to writing simple Java programs. I majored in music in college, but kept coding as a hobby, learning C++ and Python, and writing simple programs to solve small, usually mathematical, problems. As I built my experience in both music and coding, the skills that I honed the most were close collaboration with other professionals of the field, catering to the needs of each individual client, and the ability to efficiently solve problems that are often sudden and unforeseen. With these skills and my passion to tackle world problems with code, as well as an unquenchable thirst for continous learning, I can be a great asset to any project or company that I become a part of.
