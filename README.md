## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Jae Ahn-Benton, an aspiring full-stack software engineer. 

Coding and programming has always been a part of my life, but never has been in the forefront until recently. However, I think it is time for it to be the center of my professional life, as I bring all of my past skills and passions together to build a new lifelong career in a field that I am interested in and passionate about - a field that I would definitely like to work in until retirement.

### Where did I come from? And why am I here?

I am from Seoul, South Korea, and I immigrated to Las Vegas, NV at age of 10. Until high school graduation, my life revolved around two main things: math and music. Coding was a significant part of my mathematical experience, from making simple games on a TI-84 graphing calculator to writing simple Java programs. I majored in music in college, and got my real estate license in 2019. As I built my experience in both fields, the skills that I honed the most were collaboration with other professionals of the field, catering to the needs of each individual client, and the ability to efficiently solve problems that are often sudden and unforeseen. Combine these skills and my love for programming, as well as my passion to tackle world problems with code, I believe I can be a great asset to any project or company that I become a part of.

### Location
- Las Vegas, NV
- Willing to relocate

### Projects
- [Real Estate Redirect](https://github.com/jaeahn2010/real-estate-redirect)
  - First full-stack MERN app: a dynamic real estate website where a home seller can easily put their home for sale, and a home buyer can quickly browse the list of available home and directly make an offer and enter into a legal contract with the seller; the website automatically takes care of populating detailed data about any seller's listing, sending showing requests to sellers, helping buyers with filling out an offer, helping sellers interpret offers, managing negotiations and various deadlines of the contractual period for both the seller and the buyer as a neutral party, as well as provide resources for necessary third parties to both buyer and seller - all so that the buyer and seller can have a direct line of communication without any necessity of hiring real estate agents.
  - Highlights
    - Attom API autopopulating property details
    - File upload feature for verification and documentation exchange of both buyer and seller
    - Several external links for resources (lenders, sales trends, inspectors, lawyers, escrow, etc). 
- [HeyThere](https://heythere-hr-f3d27d8a0e61.herokuapp.com)
  - First team project and Django app: a generic but flexible HR website that any company may use to manipulate their own database of employees, giving tiered access to the site admin/employer, managers, and to individual employees, in order to create/edit/delete employees and their respective information, make or review time-off requests, and post or attend events. Main responsibility for this project: database manager
  - Highlights
    - Signup/Login feature based on whose email is already in the database of a specific company
    - Featured events list from Ticketmaster API, as well as embedded Google Maps from Google Maps API 
- [Greater Las Vegas Music Services](https://glv-music-services-9d9878ce0c35.herokuapp.com)
  - First full-stack application: a music business website where clients can browse through the list of available repertoire and compile their own list which they can request to a performer for any event they may be planning; each repertoire comes with a price tag, so that the client will know up front how much their specific request will cost
  - Highlights
    - Model-within-a-model: some repertoire have smaller parts called 'movements', which have their own price tags and can be individually chosen to be included in any request
- [My personal portfolio](https://jaeahn2010.github.io/portfolio/)
  - First-ever project: a front-end personal portfolio website where users can explore general information about who I am, as well as a brief look into my past self as a realtor and a classical pianist
  - Highlights
    - Modal-based resume
    - 3 classic mini-games to pass time (Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, and Memory Game with Cards)
